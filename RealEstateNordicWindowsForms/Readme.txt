Welcome to the Tax Searcher.

To Search for taxes simply select Municipality and Date.
To Add new Tax rule select Tax Type, Start Date, and insert the Tax(eg. 0,25) 
and press 'Add new Tax'.
For Week, the system will automatically select Monday-Sunday even though 
eg. Friday has been selected in the applicable week.
For Month and Year the system will also automatically set first and last day of 
the Month(eg 01-01-2019-31-01-2019) or Year(eg 01-01-2019-31-12-2019), even if a 
day in the middle of the year or month has been selected.

To add files via .CSV use the following format:
Municipality;DD-MM-YYYY;Type;TaxRate

Type could be, D(Day), W(Week), M(Month), Y(Year).
Example of a valid line:
Copenhagen;19-10-2020;D;0,25

This will select a Day Tax of 0,25 to Copenhagen on 19-10-2020.
Also see TestImport.csv for reference.

Enjoy the program.
